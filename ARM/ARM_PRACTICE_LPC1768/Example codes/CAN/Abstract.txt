The 'CAN' project is a simple program for NXP LPC1766 
using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board and demonstrates 
the use of the CAN peripheral.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            12.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  = CCLK      100.00 MHz
   - PCLK    = CCLK/4  =  25.00 MHz

 - CAN controller speed: 500 kbits
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message
   from CAN controller #2 to CAN Controller #1 
 - display received and transmitted byte values on GLCD display
 - display received byte on LEDs

This example shows how to use CAN peripheral and how to 
simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer

The CAN example is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  MCB1700:     - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)


Note: Loopback between CAN1 and CAN2 is necessary for this demo
